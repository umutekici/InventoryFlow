# Stock & Order Management

---

## ðŸ“– Project Description

This project is an **Inventory Management System** designed to monitor product stock levels across stores within a supply chain. When stock falls below a critical threshold, the system automatically places an order from the most suitable supplier.

The system integrates with the external Fake Store API for product data, while maintaining its own internal product catalog. Products are matched with Fake Store items using a common `productCode` field.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

The project is structured into two microservices: Stock and Order, and includes three class libraries for:

â€¢ Shared message contracts  
â€¢ External service integration layer  
â€¢ Middleware layer 

The application starts from the Stock Microservice.

When a product falls below its critical stock threshold, the Stock Service identifies the low-stock items and sends them to the Order Microservice.

Communication between services is handled using MassTransit with RabbitMQ. The Stock service publishes low-stock product messages to a queue, and the Order service listens to that queue.

Upon receiving the request, the Order service attempts to create a purchase order by searching for the matching product on the external Fake Store API, selecting the item with the lowest available price.

## Project Architecture

This project is structured into the following layers:

- **Shared message contracts**: Common data transfer objects (DTOs) and contracts shared between services for consistent communication.
- **External service integration layer**: Handles communication and abstraction with third-party APIs or systems.
- **Middleware layer**: Cross-cutting concerns like error handling, logging, and authentication handled in the request pipeline.

## ðŸ”§ API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                 | Description                                          |

| POST   | `/products`              | Add a new product with name, threshold, and initial stock. |
| GET    | `/products/low-stock`    | List products that are below their critical stock level.    |
| POST   | `/orders/check-and-place`| Place orders for products that are below critical stock.    |

The process of finding the product with the lowest price among the products on FakeAPI is performed in the code block below:

The Id value in the JSON object from FakeStoreAPI is matched with the Code field in the product entities on StockService.



**Bonus Task**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63cfe2ce-0c87-49e6-8416-56df60f9fcb1)

This method converts a number between 1 and 11 to a Roman numeral by subtracting the largest Roman numeral values and appending the corresponding symbols to the result string.

### Ã–rnek: 7 SayÄ±sÄ±nÄ±n Roma RakamÄ±na Ã‡evrilmesi

SayÄ±mÄ±z: **7**

DÃ¶nÃ¼ÅŸtÃ¼rme iÅŸlemi ÅŸu adÄ±mlarla gerÃ§ekleÅŸiyor:

1. Roma rakamlarÄ±nÄ± ve karÅŸÄ±lÄ±k gelen deÄŸerleri bÃ¼yÃ¼kten kÃ¼Ã§Ã¼ÄŸe ÅŸÃ¶yle listeledik:  
   `10 (X), 9 (IX), 5 (V), 4 (IV), 1 (I)`

2. 7 sayÄ±sÄ± ile listeyi baÅŸtan kontrol ediyoruz:

   - 7, 10â€™dan kÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k olduÄŸu iÃ§in atlanÄ±r.  
   - 7, 9â€™dan kÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k olduÄŸu iÃ§in atlanÄ±r.  
   - 7, 5â€™e eÅŸit veya bÃ¼yÃ¼k olduÄŸu iÃ§in Ã¶nce 5 Ã§Ä±karÄ±lÄ±r ve sonucu temsil eden `"V"` eklenir. Kalan sayÄ±: `7 - 5 = 2`.  
   - 2, 4â€™ten kÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k olduÄŸu iÃ§in atlanÄ±r.  
   - 2, 1â€™e eÅŸit veya bÃ¼yÃ¼k olduÄŸu iÃ§in `"I"` eklenir ve sayÄ± 1 azalÄ±r (2 â†’ 1).  
   - SayÄ± hÃ¢lÃ¢ 1 olduÄŸu iÃ§in tekrar `"I"` eklenir ve sayÄ± 0 olur.

3. SonuÃ§ olarak, `"V" + "I" + "I" = "VII"` elde edilir.

Bu yÃ¶ntemle sayÄ±, Ã¶nce bÃ¼yÃ¼k Roma rakamlarÄ±ndan Ã§Ä±karÄ±larak, kalan parÃ§alara karÅŸÄ±lÄ±k gelen semboller Ã¼st Ã¼ste eklenir ve doÄŸru Roma rakamÄ± oluÅŸturulur.
