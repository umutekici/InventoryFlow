# Stock & Order Management

---

## üìñ Project Description

This project is an **Inventory Management System** designed to monitor product stock levels across stores within a supply chain. When stock falls below a critical threshold, the system automatically places an order from the most suitable supplier.

The system integrates with the external Fake Store API for product data, while maintaining its own internal product catalog. Products are matched with Fake Store items using a common `productCode` field.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

The project is structured into two microservices: Stock and Order, and includes three class libraries for:

‚Ä¢ Shared message contracts  
‚Ä¢ External service integration layer  
‚Ä¢ Middleware layer 

The application starts from the Stock Microservice.

When a product falls below its critical stock threshold, the Stock Service identifies the low-stock items and sends them to the Order Microservice.

Communication between services is handled using MassTransit with RabbitMQ. The Stock service publishes low-stock product messages to a queue, and the Order service listens to that queue.

Upon receiving the request, the Order service attempts to create a purchase order by searching for the matching product on the external Fake Store API, selecting the item with the lowest available price.
